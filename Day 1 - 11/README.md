**Day 1:**

Today I started off by creating a GitHub account as well as a Kaggle account. I hope that by keeping track of my progress throughout these 66 days, I can ensure that I 
fully complete this challenge.
I was a bit ambitious today and completed both the Python and Intro to Machine Learning courses on Kaggle. My certificates for these two can be found within the certificate folder.
I have previous experience in Python and Machine Learning as I have taken courses in these topics at Ryerson University. The courses were fairly simple to complete and I would 
recommend them to anyone looking to start their data science journey. 

I also played with the idea of creating a blog to keep track of my progress using github pages. However, I've decided to use github as my main platform.

**Day 2:**

Today I worked on the first two lessons within the Data Visualization course on Kaggle. I hope to complete the course and gain my certificate by tomorrow. This course teaches you how to produce data visualization using Python, more specifically Seaborn. I have not worked with Seaborn before so this is an interesting course for me. I'm really enjoying this course as I like being able to look at a graph and tell a story based off it's features.

**Day 3:**

Today I worked on learning how to produce barplots, heatmaps and scatterplots using Seaborn. I didn't have as much time this morning to finish the Data Visualization certificate. If I'm not able to get back to it today after work, I'd like to find time to finish it tomorrow.

**Day 4:**
I finally finished the data visualization certificate! It has definitely been hard to put in the work while working a full time job and having a new puppy at home. I like to find at least an hour to sit down and get some learning in. Today I was taught some more plots that I can create using Seaborn. I also learned which plots are best to use in different cases and how to style charts in different ways. I can definitely say that data visualization is one of my favourite parts of the data analyzing process. I enjoy being able to tell a story from a visual.

**Day 5&6:**
I have found myself much busier than usual at the beginning of 2021 and wasn't able to keep up with the 66 days of data challenge. However, I'm back and ready to continue from where I left off. The past two days I have worked on enhancing my phython skills using the pandas library. I have succesfully started and c ompleted the course on Kaggle. Check out the "Certificates" folder to see my new certificate!
