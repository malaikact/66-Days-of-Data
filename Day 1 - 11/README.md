**Day 1:**

Today I started off by creating a GitHub account as well as a Kaggle account. I hope that by keeping track of my progress throughout these 66 days, I can ensure that I 
fully complete this challenge.
I was a bit ambitious today and completed both the Python and Intro to Machine Learning courses on Kaggle. My certificates for these two can be found within the certificate folder.
I have previous experience in Python and Machine Learning as I have taken courses in these topics at Ryerson University. The courses were fairly simple to complete and I would 
recommend them to anyone looking to start their data science journey. 

I also played with the idea of creating a blog to keep track of my progress using github pages. However, I've decided to use github as my main platform.
