**Day 12:**
Today's challenge was all about descriptive statistics. Reviewing how to perform statistical calculations and functions within Python.

**Day 13:** 
Today's challenge was about creating functions and cleaning data within Python. It was a nice refresher from a Python course I had taken previously.

**Day 14:** 
Today's challenge was about the pandas library and understanding how to use it. I also started studing for my midterm. I'm enrolled in the data analytics certificate program at Ryerson University and am currently taking a course about database structures. This includes learning about SQL and its features.

**Day 15 - 17:**
I took off this past week from work and spent it relaxing at home and learning some more data science techniques. I completed my daily lighthouse lab challenges as well as started my first project on Kaggle! I enlisted the help of some previous notebooks to get me on the right path. So far I have an accuracy score of .7635. I'm looking to continue working on my increase my score. I plan to take the kaggle data cleaning course to refresh my memory on the subject. Doing my first project really enforced how important the data cleaning process is in order to get an accurate result.
