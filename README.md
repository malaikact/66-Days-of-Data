# 66-Days-of-Data
I will be participating in the 66 Days of Data Challenge and keeping track of what I have reviewed each day.
I am new to the data science field and I'm excited to see how I can grow my skills within the next 66 days!

"Why 66 days? Because it is the average amount of days needed to establish a new habit. Creating solid data science habits is one of the most powerful things we can do to have longevity in this every dynamic field of technology." - Ken Jee
